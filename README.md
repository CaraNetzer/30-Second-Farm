# Project Description
For my final CS50G project, I created a short-form farming game with Love2D called 30 Second Farm. The premise of the game is to plant and collect as many plants as you can in a (30 second) day while avoiding moles that randomly pop up around the garden. At the end of a day, you place your harvest in a collection chest and gain experience based on the number and type of plants you've collected. You have three lives per day, if you run into a mole three times, that's game over. Each level that you reach introduces a new type of plant. You win when you've leveled up 9 times, having found and collected all of the 8 types of plants. 


# Game how-to:
- Head to the garden each morning
- Plant and collect as many vegetables from your garden as you can without running into moles before the day is done (Press p to plant a seed)
- Place your dayâ€™s harvest in the bin (Press i to deposit inventory)
- Another day begins
- Discover all 8 plants to win!
- In game, press m to return to the main menu


To run the game, clone this repository, and run with Love2D (https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
